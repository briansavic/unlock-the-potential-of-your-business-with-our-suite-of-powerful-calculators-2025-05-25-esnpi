Entrepreneurs and small business owners need reliable tools to make informed decisions about funding, and one such indispensable tool is the Business Loans Calculator.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What Is a Business Loans Calculator?</h2>
                <p>A Business Loans Calculator is an online or software-based tool designed to help business owners estimate loan payments, interest rates, and repayment schedules. By inputting key variables—such as loan amount, interest rate, and loan term—you can quickly generate accurate projections of your financial obligations.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">How to Use a Business Loans Calculator</h2>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">Step 1: Input the Loan Amount</h3>
                <p>Enter the principal amount you intend to borrow. This could range from a few thousand dollars for a small business line of credit to millions for expansion projects.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">Step 2: Enter the Interest Rate</h3>
                <p>Input the expected interest rate. This can be a fixed or variable rate, depending on your loan agreement.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">Step 3: Select the Loan Term</h3>
                <p>Choose your preferred loan term. Remember that shorter terms mean higher payments but lower total interest, while longer terms reduce monthly costs but increase overall interest.</p>
