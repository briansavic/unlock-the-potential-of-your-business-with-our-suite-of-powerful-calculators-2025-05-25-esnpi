                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">A Business Loans Calculator is an essential tool for small businesses to estimate loan repayments and evaluate financing options. The calculator requires three main inputs: loan amount, term length, and interest rate to compute monthly payments and total costs. Different versions exist for specific business types, including startups, women-owned businesses, restaurants, and sole traders. The tool helps entrepreneurs assess loan affordability, compare offers, and plan cash flow effectively. While calculators provide valuable estimates, final loan terms depend on factors like creditworthiness and lender requirements. Using a business loans calculator enables informed borrowing decisions and sustainable financial planning.</p>
